Today, I attended an enlightening workshop on "Digital Productivity and AI in the Workplace," delivered by Matthew Mort and Matthew Hayden from the School of Medicine. Despite considering myself fairly knowledgeable about AI, this session proved that there's always something new to learn in this rapidly evolving field.

## Opening Perspectives

The session began with an engaging Menti activity, where participants shared their immediate thoughts about AI. What struck me most was the diversity of responses – ranging from optimistic views about innovation to concerns about the unknown. This variety of perspectives highlighted how our backgrounds and experiences shape our understanding of AI.

We then dove into a SWOT analysis in groups, where I had the opportunity to discuss personalised learning – a topic I'm particularly passionate about. It was reassuring to see this highlighted as one of the key opportunities in the AI landscape.

## Critical Reflections on AI's Impact

During discussions about AI risks, an important question emerged: Could AI development create a significant societal divide? There's a potential scenario where those who embrace and understand AI become increasingly empowered, while others who are unable or unwilling to engage with the technology fall behind. This digital divide could potentially deepen existing social inequalities – a concern that warrants further exploration.

## Key Insights and Learnings

Several valuable concepts emerged during the workshop:

### 1. The Importance of Open Dialogue

The session created a safe space for open conversations about AI, which is crucial given the technology's rapid development and widespread impact. These discussions help build a balanced understanding of both opportunities and challenges.

### 2. "AI is About Mindset Than Tech"

This phrase particularly resonated with me. It emphasises that success with AI isn't just about technical knowledge – it's about maintaining a growth mindset and being open to embracing change. This was evident in our initial activity, where responses ranged from "change" to "terminator," revealing varying levels of openness to AI adoption.

### 3. Practical Applications and Tools

The workshop included hands-on experience with various AI tools:

- Microsoft Copilot for basic and advanced prompting
- Exploration of different AI models including Gemini and Claude
- Introduction to Google NotebookLM, which showed impressive potential for transforming learning materials into interactive content

## Advanced Topics and Future Possibilities

The second half of the session, led by Matt Hayden, focused on prompt engineering and advanced AI applications. We explored best practices for crafting effective prompts, including the importance of providing examples and assigning specific roles to AI models.

### Creative Prompting Exercise

One particularly engaging exercise involved generating names for alcoholic beverages. We used the following prompt:

> Take the role of a male, aged 18-35. What would be the name of an alcoholic beverage that might attract you? The tone should be mildly humourous and not sound too toxically masculine. The name should not sound like any existing products in the UK. Provide ten examples in a three column array. Column one should contain the name. Column two should be what you rate that suggestion in order of one to ten. Column three should explain your reasoning. Some example would be MoonBrew, AuAle, BarleBite.

Among the generated names, "Brewtiful" stood out to me personally, as it reminded me of how my sons playfully pronounce "beautiful" as "butiful." I then experimented further by asking Copilot to generate matching branding and color schemes for this name, demonstrating how AI can assist in creative processes from initial concept to visual design.

### Data Governance and Security

An important aspect we discussed was data governance and security considerations when using AI tools. Cardiff University has established data policies that guide what information should and shouldn't be shared with chatbots. The session emphasized the importance of exercising common sense when deciding what data to input into AI systems. Additionally, we discussed the significance of reviewing each AI application's data policy before use - a crucial practice in maintaining data security and compliance.

An interesting discussion emerged about the varying capabilities of different AI models and their accessibility. The difference between free and paid versions of AI tools raises important questions about equity in access to advanced AI capabilities.

## Looking Forward

The introduction to tools like Google NotebookLM highlighted exciting possibilities for education, particularly in creating more inclusive learning experiences through features like converting text resources into interactive chat spaces and podcasts.

## Resources for Further Exploration

For those interested in diving deeper, here are some valuable resources shared during the session:

- [JISC National Centre for AI](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/innovation/artificial-intelligence)
- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
- [Google NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)

## Final Thoughts

This workshop demonstrated that regardless of your current AI knowledge, there's always room for learning and growth. The key isn't just understanding the technology itself, but developing the right mindset to embrace and effectively utilise these tools in our professional lives.

The session's success in creating an atmosphere conducive to open dialogue about AI technology shows how important it is to continue these conversations as we navigate the future of work and learning. As AI continues to evolve, maintaining this balance of practical knowledge and thoughtful discussion will be crucial for building an inclusive and effective digital future.

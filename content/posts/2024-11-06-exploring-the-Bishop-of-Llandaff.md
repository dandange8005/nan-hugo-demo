Today, we visited the Bishop of Llandaff, a well-regarded Church in Wales high school located in Cardiff, for its open day and also met Amelia and her family. The Bishop of Llandaff is known for its strong emphasis on both academic and spiritual development, and it consistently ranks among the top-performing schools in Cardiff. Compared to other high schools in the area, such as Cardiff High and Whitchurch, it places a particular focus on nurturing a supportive community atmosphere with smaller class sizes and an emphasis on values-driven education. However, the school’s infrastructure and facilities are not as modern as some other high schools, which may affect its appeal.

According to the headteacher, the school maintains a high academic standard, which is always reassuring. However, being a church school, they have strict admission guidelines—150 places for students from Christian backgrounds and 30 for those from non-Christian backgrounds.

## First Impressions

We took a quick tour of the school, but in terms of facilities, it was not particularly impressive. It certainly didn’t match the standard of Cathedral, and even compared to Whitchurch, it felt a bit outdated. The students seemed nice, but the school clearly needs investment in its infrastructure. Another concern is that the road leading to the school is likely to be heavily congested, which could make drop-offs and pick-ups difficult.

We didn't spend too much time at the school, as the alarm went off several times while we were there, which certainly didn't make for a good experience. The building was somewhat confusing, and there didn't seem to be many students available to guide us. Unlike Cathedral, the school felt a bit grim and dark.

## A Stop at the Music Classroom

Ethan insisted we visit the music classroom, so we did. There was one piano, and some senior students were playing. Ethan tried out some keyboards, and he seemed to really enjoy the music, showing confidence with his piano skills, which made me happy. Music has always been something he loves, and seeing him comfortable in that setting brought me joy. However, I still want him to be more confident when speaking to strangers or teenagers, as he was still quite shy. But deep inside, I know he is very knowledgeable and a thoughtful, philosophical boy.

## Reflections on the Visit

On our way back home, I asked Ethan how he felt about the school. He wasn’t particularly impressed, especially because he doesn’t connect with the church or religious aspects. I’m unsure if placing him in that kind of environment would make him feel comfortable. It’s important to me that Ethan feels at ease wherever he studies.

In comparison to other schools we’ve visited, such as Cathedral, which felt much more vibrant and engaging, the Bishop of Llandaff seemed somewhat lacking. While the academic reputation is excellent, the atmosphere didn’t seem to resonate with Ethan.

## What's Next?

I suppose we will need to wait for Ethan to decide whether this is the right school for him. It’s a significant decision, and I want him to have a say in where he spends the next few years of his education. We will continue exploring other schools and options to ensure we find the best fit for his personality, interests, and comfort.

Choosing a school is never easy—it’s about balancing academics, environment, and personal comfort. Each visit brings us closer to understanding what Ethan needs and where he will thrive, and today’s experience at the Bishop of Llandaff added another piece to that puzzle.
